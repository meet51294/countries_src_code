    <p>A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent
      sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state [1], as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division,
      or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct
      political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition
      as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is
      subject to the independent exercise[clarification needed] of legal jurisdiction.[citation needed] Sometimes countries
      refers both to sovereign states and to other political entities,[2] while other times it refers only to states.[3]
      For example, the CIA World Factbook uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies,
      areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
      states"
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Etymology and usage</h2>
    <p>The word country comes from Old French contrée, which derives from Vulgar Latin (terra) contrata ("(land) lying opposite";
      "(land) spread before"), derived from contra ("against, opposite"). It most likely entered the English language after
      the Franco-Norman invasion during the 11th century.
      <br>
      <br> In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with
      the indefinite article – "a country" – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a synonym for state, or a former
      sovereign state, in the sense of sovereign territory or "district, native land".[5] Areas much smaller than a political
      state may be called by names such as the West Country in England, the Black Country (a heavily industrialized part
      of England), "Constable Country" (a part of East Anglia painted by John Constable), the "big country" (used in various
      contexts of the American West), "coal country" (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.[6]
      <br>
      <br> The equivalent terms in French and other Romance languages (pays and variants) have not carried the process of being
      identified with political sovereign states as far as the English "country", instead derived from, pagus, which designated
      the territory controlled by a medieval count, a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries
      the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the German Bundesländer, as well as a less formal
      term for a sovereign state. France has very many "pays" that are officially recognised at some level, and are either
      natural regions, like the Pays de Bray, or reflect old political or economic entities, like the Pays de la Loire.
      <br>
      <br> A version of "country" can be found in the modern French language as contrée, based on the word cuntrée in Old French,[6]
      that is used similarly to the word "pays" to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political
      state in some particular cases. The modern Italian contrada is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually
      meaning a ward or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Sovereignty status</h2>
    <p>The term "country" can refer to a sovereign state. There is no universal agreement on the number of "countries" in the
      world, since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status. There are 206 sovereign states, of which 193 states
      are members of the United Nations, two states have observer status at the U.N. (the Holy See and Palestine), and 11
      other states are neither a member or observer at the U.N. All are defined as states by declarative theory of statehood
      and constitutive theory of statehood. The latest proclaimed state is South Sudan in 2011.
      <br>
      <br> Although not sovereign states, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are usually referred to as countries
      (depending on context), which collectively form the United Kingdom—a sovereign state that is also referred to as a
      country.[7][8][9][10] The Kingdom of Denmark, a sovereign state, comprises Mainland Denmark and two nominally separate
      countries—the Faroe Islands, and Greenland—which are almost fully internally self-governing. The Kingdom of the Netherlands,
      a sovereign state, comprises four separate countries: Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. In the Kingdom
      of Spain, the regions of Galicia, the Catalan speaking parts (Catalonia, Valencia and Balearic Islands) and the Basque
      Country are sometimes recognized as non-sovereign states or group of states (namely, autonomous communities under the
      Spanish law), specially within nationalist movements[clarification needed].
      <br>
      <br> The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several
      states have overseas territories (such as French Polynesia or the British Virgin Islands), with citizenry at times
      identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct dependent territories,
      are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate
      "country of origin" in international trade, as Hong Kong is.</p>
